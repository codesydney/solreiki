## E. Meeting Action Items
#### E.1 Meeting held on Sunday 3rd May
<s> - We discussed Code.Sydney's interest for SolReiki to have full control of their content by providing the option to manage their blog entries themselves and more importantly manage products/services from Ovatu. In both cases, dependency on developers is eliminated</s>
<br/>
 - Proceed on applying the fonts and colours as proposed
<br/>
 - Include placeholder footage on the homepage to showcase the capability of including a raw video on the page
<br/>
<s> - Understand how to customise the look-and-feel of an Ovatu wireframe</s>
<br/>
 - Change FAQs page by including an accordion-type of display for each section and removing submenus from the navbar
<br/>
<s> - Check Ovatu CTA(call to action) for Events</s>
<br/>
<s> - Check the inclusion of videos/images on the blog content editing when using a markup language.</s>
<br/>
 - Adam/Nid/Adele to signup to Ovatu and start familiarising themselves to its features.
<br/>
<s> - As agreed, any future Code.Sydney meeting request will be booked via https://www.code.sydney/contact.</s>
