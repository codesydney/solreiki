                        After an experience of Oneness in the foothills of Greece 20 years ago, I became a student of ancient teachings, practicing Buddhism and Kundalini meditation. I took this further by becoming a qualified teacher of Vedic meditation, a Reiki Master and a breathwork facilitator.
                        We are all connected to Universal energy, which can help us balance and heal our mind, body and spirit. Reiki is a wonderful, gentle and non-intrusive healing art from Japan, and is a relaxing experience. Through my intuitive connection to spirit, I create a calm, caring and easy environment in which you can relax deeply and let your body heal. Reiki is a fast and effective method for you to improve your wellness in the modern world. As a Reiki Master, I can teach you to treat yourself with SolReiki’s empowering trainings.

                            I became an energy healer via the unusual route of a PhD and working as a neuroscientist for many years. 
                            I’ve always been fascinated with science and how the world and our bodies work.
                            During a chronic state of unwellness while my boys were young, I learned to meditate and retrained as a yoga and meditation teacher. 
                            It was a natural extension of my curiosity about how things work 
                            - only this time my own body and mind were under the ‘microscope’ of my developing conscious awareness. 
                            Instead of the fluorescent light scanning microscopy I’d left behind in the lab, it was light scanning healing meditations and the like that fixed me up and expanded my mind to connect to universal consciousness. 
                            Reiki is the fastest and most efficient way I’ve learned so far to tap into this state. 
                            It’s like hot-wiring the body to be able to receive the energy that’s all around us all the time. 
                            The practitioner acts as a conduit for this energy by using focussed attention and positive intention. 
                            The healing is done by your own body - it simply puts the extra boost of energy to good use. 
                            When I’m treating people, I love seeing the shifts that start to happen as they reconnect to their own inner guidance. 
                            It shines out of their eyes. That’s the best bit. xxx

                            I’m an intuitive healer, mentor and empath. 
                            Throughout my life I was hypersensitive to others and receiving messages from alternative worlds. 
                            This contributed to 30 years of depression and anxiety struggles. 
                            Only after a head injury and years of healing work did I learn how these challenges were my gifts. 
                            Through Reiki healing I felt calm, balanced emotions and allowed myself to let go of my fears. 
                            This led me to meditation practices and deepened my practice of yoga philosophy to live each day.   
                            My role is to provide a safe space for my clients to allow healing to occur and always see their beauty. 
                            When they are ready to receive what serves them best, I witness the most beautiful blossomings of the soul embodied in human form. 
                            Reiki healing is a magical experience to share with someone as it brings pure loving energy through them so that they can be their best self in any given moment.
